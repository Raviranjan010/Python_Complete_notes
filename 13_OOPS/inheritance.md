# Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class (Child) to derive attributes and methods from another class (Parent).

## Syntax
```python
class Parent:
    pass

class Child(Parent):
    pass
```

## Types of Inheritance
1.  **Single**: One Child from One Parent.
2.  **Multiple**: One Child from Multiple Parents.
3.  **Multilevel**: Grandparent -> Parent -> Child.
4.  **Hierarchical**: Multiple Children from One Parent.
