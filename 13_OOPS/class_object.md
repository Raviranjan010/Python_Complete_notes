# Class and Object

## 🏭 Class (Blueprint)
A Class is a user-defined data type. It is a **blueprint** for creating objects.
It doesn't occupy memory until an object is created.
```python
class Car:
    color = "Red"
```

## 🚗 Object (Instance)
An Object is an **instance** of a Class.
When an object is created, memory is allocated.
```python
my_car = Car()
```
