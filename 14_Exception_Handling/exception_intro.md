# Exception Handling

## 🐞 Errors vs Exceptions
-   **Syntax Errors**: Code violates validation rules (e.g., missing `:`). Detected before execution.
-   **Exceptions**: Errors occurring **during execution** (e.g., division by zero, file not found).

## Why Handle Exceptions?
If an exception occurs, the program **crashes**.
Exception handling allows us to catch the error and gracefully continue or exit.
